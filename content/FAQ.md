### What is your service area?
* Seattle
* Mercer Island
* Shoreline
* Kirkland
* Bellevue
* Redmond
* Newcastle

We work outside of these areas on a case-by-case basis.

### Are you insured?
We are licensed through the State of Washington, have a $2M insurance policy through American Family Insurance, and have full health coverage.

### Do you do high-rise?
**No.** For safety, liability, and operational reasons we do not do work higher than three stories.

### What are your prices?
Every home is different, but a good rule of thumb is that most inside & out window cleanings will cost **20¢ times the total square footage of your home.** This includes wiping down the tracks, frames, and screens, plus the bathroom mirrors for free!

There are additional costs for:
* French pane windows 
* Tall contemporary/A-frame homes
* Antique single-pane glass
* Glass terrariums/solariums
* Storm windows/inserts
* Glass deck railing panels ($9.00 each)

### What other services do you offer?
* **Gutter Cleaning** offered on steep roofs with gutters no higher than two storeys above ground level, or shallow-sloped roofs three storeys or less. We will ensure that your downspouts are flushed and free of clogs and can offer **gutter fascia brightening** as an additional service upon request.
* **Pressure Washing** for driveways, patios and walkways, and natural wood or composite decks. We do not offer pressure washing of siding or roofs.
* **Moss Treatment** We apply Wet & Forget to mossy areas of roofs on dry days when it will soak into the moss. The Wet & Forget will activate during the next rain, killing it at the root and causing it to fall off over time without no damage your roof's shingles.

### Cancellation policy?
Please give 24 hours notice if you need to cancel or reschedule an appointment. If we feel that the weather is too hot (over 90°F) or cold (under 36°F), or stormy (heavy rain with 12+ mph winds), we will call to either confirm or reschedule.

### What do I need to do before getting my windows cleaned?
Nothing! We will take care of moving any objects away from the windows. If you have any extremely fragile/sharp plants or objects blocking your windows we prefer they are removed in advance. Our #1 goal every time is to leave your home as if we were never there, except for the sparkling clean windows!

### Covid-19?
We are vaccinated and boosted, and are happy to wear masks inside your home upon request.

### What forms of payment do you accept?
We accept checks, cash, bank bill pay, and can accept debit/credit cards via Square. If you will not be present at time of service we can also send an invoice via Square for a 3.3% fee.

### Do you send out crews? Who's this "we" and "us?"
No. Invisible Glass Seattle is a sole proprietorship consisting exclusively of Jonathon McCullough, who has been making use of "the corporate *we*" throughout this website to avoid syntactical weirdness. We appreciate the awkwardness of inviting strangers into your home. That's why when you hire Invisible Glass Seattle, you are getting a trusted and experienced professional who takes pride in their craftsmanship.
