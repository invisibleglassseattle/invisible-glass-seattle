### What is your service area?
* Seattle
* Mercer Island
* Shoreline
* Kirkland
* Bellevue
* Redmond
* Newcastle

We work outside of these areas on a case-by-case basis.

### Are you insured?
We have an insurance policy through American Family Insurance and have full health coverage.

### Do you do high-rise?
**No.** For safety, liability, and operational reasons we do not do work higher than three stories.

### I only want a few windows done, or only the outsides of my windows...
Unfortunately, due to operational costs and safety/quality concerns, we do <u>not</u> offer "<u>piecework</u>" or <u>exterior only</u> window cleaning. You wouldn't want to buy half-invisible windows!

### What are your prices?
Every home is different, but a good rule of thumb is that most inside & out window cleanings will cost **18¢ times the total square footage of your home.** This includes wiping down the tracks, frames, and screens, plus the bathroom mirrors for free!

There are additional costs for:
* French pane windows 
* Tall contemporary/A-frame homes
* Antique single-pane glass
* Glass terrariums/solariums
* Storm windows/inserts
* Glass deck railing panels ($9.00 each)

### Do you do gutters?
Due to operational and safety concerns we can do gutters on a case-by-case basis depending on roof access and slope. We hope to expand this service in the near future!

### Cancellation policy?
Please give 24 hours notice if you need to cancel or reschedule an appointment. If we feel that the weather is too hot (over 90°F) or cold (under 36°F), or stormy (heavy rain with 12+ mph winds), we will call to either confirm or reschedule.

### What do I need to do before getting my windows cleaned?
We will take care of moving any objects away from the windows. If you have any extremely fragile/sharp plants or objects blocking your windows we prefer they are removed in advance.

### Covid-19?
We are vaccinated and boosted, and are happy to wear masks inside your home upon request.

### What forms of payment do you accept?
We currently accept checks, cash, bank bill pay, and can accept debit/credit cards via Square.

### Do you send out crews? Who's this "we" and "us?"
No. Invisible Glass Seattle is a sole proprietorship consisting exclusively of Jonathon McCullough, who has been making use of "the corporate *we*" throughout this website to avoid syntactical weirdness. We appreciate the awkwardness of inviting strangers into your home. That's why when you hire Invisible Glass Seattle, you are getting a trusted and experienced professional who takes pride in their craftsmanship.
