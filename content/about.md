Hi! I'm Jonathon McCullough, owner and operator of Invisible Glass Seattle! I’ve been doing residential and low-level commercial window washing in Gig Harbor, North Tacoma, and Kitsap County since 2007 (formerly with A Touch of Glass Window Washing) and am now bringing my skills to the greater Seattle area!
I'm looking forward to being the consistent, professional, and trustworthy window washer you’ve been looking for!
